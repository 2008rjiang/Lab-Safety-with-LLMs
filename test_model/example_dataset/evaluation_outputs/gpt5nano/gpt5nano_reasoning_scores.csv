image0047,4,Strong,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The prediction infers a safe, bio/cleanroom context and cites concrete PPE (hooded suit, goggles, gloves) and absence of hazards, which aligns with a SAFE label. No contradictions or hallucinated risks. It doesn’t explicitly tie to categories beyond PPE, so not fully verifiable for a perfect score."
image0447,4,Strong,"Correctly flags loose hair and a biology wet-lab context, indicating an unsafe situation. However, it misses the GT key issue of improper footwear and adds an extra note about missing eye protection not cited in GT. Overall aligned but not complete."
image0804,5,Exceptional,"Directly identifies missing gloves and eye protection (PPE) as the safety issues and frames it in a chemistry context, matching GT drivers and implied unsafe label with no contradictions."
image1226,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns with a safe wet-lab biology setting, noting gloves, pipette use, and organized workspace (PPE/SOP/WO). No contradictions or invented hazards. Lacks confirmable GT-specific drivers to merit exceptional."
image1414,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction frames it as a safe EE setup, notes PPE (safety glasses) and a minor WO note (cable clutter), and avoids invented hazards. This aligns with implied labels; however, without GT specifics, some cited details (e.g., glasses) can’t be verified, so not Exceptional."
