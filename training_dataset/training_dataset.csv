The main problems are poor workspace organization (clutter and combustible items left on the bench) and deviations from chemical-handling SOPs (open storage of flammables, unlabeled containers, liquids near electrical outlets). These issues collectively elevate the risks of fire, chemical exposure, and electrical accidents.",
