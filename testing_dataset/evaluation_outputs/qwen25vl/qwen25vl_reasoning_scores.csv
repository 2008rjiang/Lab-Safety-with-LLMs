image0007,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The prediction highlights PPE presence, supporting safety, but asserts a bio lab type and specific PPE items that aren’t in the GT rationale, so alignment beyond safety is unverified."
image0008,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction supports safety by citing PPE (gloves, goggles), a specific detail. However, it assumes a biological lab without GT support and cannot reference any GT drivers, so alignment is limited."
image0009,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE), and the prediction cites specific PPE (gloves, goggles) consistent with a safe biological context. However, it assumes a bio lab and safety without explicit GT confirmation and provides limited justification beyond PPE."
image0019,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The model implies safety via proper PPE, which plausibly aligns, but it speculates a bio lab and specific PPE presence not supported by GT. Justification is somewhat generic and adds unverifiable specifics."
image0024,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction supports safety by noting PPE (coat, gloves, mask), aligning with a PPE-based rationale. However, it assumes a bio lab and specific items without GT confirmation and doesn’t tie to explicit GT drivers, so it’s somewhat generic relative to the absent details."
image0029,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction emphasizes proper PPE and suggests a chemical lab, which aligns with a safe assessment. However, it introduces unverified specifics (e.g., Bunsen burner) and doesn’t clearly map to GT drivers or categories, so alignment is only general rather than fully evidenced."
image0033,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction reasonably implies a safe scenario by citing specific PPE (gloves, mask, lab coat). However, there’s no GT detail to match and it asserts a chemical lab context not evidenced by GT, so can’t award higher."
image0034,1,Weak,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE), so there’s no evidence to confirm bio lab type or PPE specifics. The prediction asserts bio context and PPE use without GT support and doesn’t justify labels beyond a generic claim."
image0047,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction cites PPE presence (coat, gloves, goggles), supporting a safe assessment. However, it assumes a bio lab without GT support and doesn’t address other categories (SOP/WO), so alignment is limited to generic PPE-based safety."
image0049,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction supports safety by citing PPE (coat, gloves, goggles), which justifies a safe status and references the PPE category. However, it asserts a biological lab type and specific PPE presence that cannot be verified from GT, so it’s over-specific relative to the provided rationale."
image0057,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The model notes concrete PPE (lab coats, goggles), which supports a safe assessment, but it assumes a chemical lab without GT support and doesn’t explicitly state safety status or address categories beyond PPE."
image0058,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (implies SAFE). The model aligns on safety and cites a concrete detail (safety glasses). However, lab type and category alignment cannot be verified from GT, and reasoning is fairly generic."
image0066,2,Partial,"GT rationale is absent (likely SAFE), which is fine, but the prediction does not state safety status and speculates a chemical lab from a robotic arm. It mentions PPE and SOP via tablet use, but provides weak linkage to labels and potentially incorrect lab type. Limited alignment with GT and lacks concrete drivers."
image0069,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction notes PPE (goggles), which aligns generally, but it injects an unsupported lab type (biological) and doesn’t clearly justify safety status or cover categories. Some correctness, but vague and includes a likely hallucination."
image0082,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely a SAFE image). The prediction mentions PPE (lab coats, gloves) but doesn’t clearly state safety status and asserts a bio lab type without GT support. Limited linkage to labels and potentially speculative lab type, though it cites a relevant PPE detail."
image0089,2,Partial,"GT has no details (typical of SAFE); the prediction notes PPE presence, which could support safety, but it does not explicitly state safety status, introduces an unverified lab type (biological), and doesn’t tie to categories. Overall vague linkage to implied labels."
image0091,3,Adequate,"Correctly implies SAFE by citing specific PPE (lab coats, goggles). However, it assumes a chemical lab type without GT support and gives a generic safety claim, with limited linkage beyond PPE."
image0099,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction implies safe behavior by citing proper PPE (goggles, gloves), aligning generally with a safe assessment and PPE category. However, it doesn’t explicitly state safety status and assumes a chemical lab without GT support, so specificity to GT drivers is limited."
image0101,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction cites specific PPE (lab coats, gloves) implying safe adherence, which is plausible. However, it asserts a biological lab type without GT support and doesn’t address SOP/WO, so specificity to labels is limited."
image0103,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction cites specific PPE (lab coats, gloves) and a microscope/computers implying a bio lab, which broadly supports a safe assessment. However, it doesn’t explicitly state the safety status, only covers PPE (not SOP/WO), and assumes a bio lab type that cannot be confirmed from GT."
image0105,2,Partial,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE), so there’s little to match. The prediction implies safety via PPE (goggles), which could align, but it invents a lab type (electrical work) not supported by GT and provides only a single, minimal driver. Weak linkage to GT labels and potential hallucination lower confidence."
image0110,1,Weak,"GT provides no details (likely SAFE), but the model assumes a biological lab and infers safety from gloves. It offers a generic PPE note without confirmed GT drivers or labels, and introduces potentially misleading lab-type assumptions."
image0112,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction highlights lab coats and goggles, supporting safety with a specific PPE detail. However, it assumes a bio lab without GT support and doesn’t clearly tie to any GT categories, so only partially aligned."
image0116,4,Strong,"Likely aligns with implied SAFE status by citing specific PPE (lab coats, gloves, goggles). However, it assumes a bio lab type not supported by GT and doesn’t address other categories; otherwise no contradictions."
image0117,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The prediction notes proper PPE (coats, gloves, goggles) and implies a safe chemical lab, which aligns with a SAFE status. However, it doesn’t explicitly state safety, and the lab type/categorization cannot be confirmed from GT, so alignment is general rather than specific."
image0121,3,Adequate,"Likely matches implied SAFE status by citing PPE and SOP compliance. However, with no GT details provided, the claimed bio lab type and specific items (hairnets, gloves, clipboard/test tubes) can’t be verified against GT, so alignment beyond general safety is unclear."
image0125,2,Partial,"GT provides no details (expected for SAFE), but the prediction asserts a specific lab type (biological) without GT support and never states safety status. It mentions PPE (lab coats), which is a relevant detail, but lacks linkage to the GT labels and is incomplete on categories/SOP/WO."
image0131,1,Weak,Does not mention the GT driver (missing eye protection) or unsafe status. Focuses on gloves (irrelevant to the cited issue) and implies chemical lab without supporting the PPE gap. Little alignment with GT rationale.
image0143,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags an unsafe PPE issue: missing eye protection. The prediction instead portrays the scene as organized/safe, does not mention missing goggles, and focuses on lab coats/organization. It also asserts a chemistry lab without supporting the key GT driver. Contradicts the GT safety status and misses the PPE issue."
image0145,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags PPE issue: missing gloves (unsafe). Prediction highlights lab coat and goggles, implying adequate PPE/safety and never mentions the missing gloves. Contradicts the GT driver and fails to justify the unsafe PPE label."
image0154,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: GT flags unsafe due to missing gloves (PPE). Prediction claims PPE adherence via goggles, implies safety, and hallucinates a bio lab. Does not mention the key driver (missing gloves)."
image0156,1,Weak,"Does not address the GT driver (missing gloves). Focuses on presence of goggles instead, offering no justification for the unsafe PPE issue and potentially misleading about safety status."
image0158,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags UNSAFE due to missing eye protection (PPE). The prediction claims proper PPE (hairnet, gloves) in a bio lab and never mentions absent eye protection, contradicting the key GT driver and implying safety."
image0163,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: claims safe Bio lab with SOP adherence, while GT flags unsafe conditions in a chemical context—missing gloves, missing eye protection, and chemicals near a computer. No GT drivers cited; adds irrelevant/hallucinated stethoscope detail."
image0168,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT by claiming goggles are worn and implying safety, while GT cites missing goggles and missing gloves as hazards. Omits the missing gloves issue and adds an unfounded bio-lab context. Does not align with unsafe PPE rationale."
image0169,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsafe due to missing gloves (PPE). Prediction ignores gloves, implies proper PPE by noting a lab coat, and speculates a biological lab. Does not address the key hazard or safety status; misleading relative to GT."
image0171,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Fails to identify the GT hazard (missing eye protection) and instead emphasizes existing PPE, implying safety. Does not justify unsafe status or the PPE category issue, and adds an unsupported bio lab inference."
image0174,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: claims gloves and hairnet present and implies safe, while GT cites missing gloves and unsecured hair as hazards. Even if bio lab context might fit, the key PPE details are wrong, misleading the safety status and categories."
image0201,1,Weak,Does not mention the key GT issue (missing eye protection) or unsafe status; instead focuses on a lab coat and assumes a biological lab. Little alignment with GT drivers and could mislead labels.
image0208,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: claims proper PPE due to goggles and implies safety, while GT flags missing gloves and unsecured hair (PPE issues). No mention of GT drivers; misleads lab safety status."
image0211,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Mislabels safety status as safe despite GT unsafe; omits key GT drivers (missing eye protection, unsafe exposed circuit handling, tangled cables). Only lab type (EE) aligns, but overall contradicts GT and provides no PPE/SOP/WO evidence."
image0214,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction highlights PPE (gloves, lab coat) and a chemistry context (fume hood, chemical bottles), implying safe conditions. It provides at least one concrete detail (PPE) but doesn’t explicitly state safety status or cover categories beyond PPE, and specific GT drivers can’t be verified."
image0216,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (consistent with SAFE). The prediction argues safety via PPE/SOP, aligning with a safe status and giving specific PPE details. However, it speculates bio lab type and specific items (hairnet, goggles, microscope) not supported by GT, so alignment beyond safety status is uncertain."
image0224,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsafe due to untied hair and lack of proper PPE. The prediction claims adherence to PPE (white lab coats) and implies safety, failing to mention untied hair or missing PPE. Only minor match is bio lab context; core drivers are contradicted."
image0229,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags a PPE violation: missing gloves (unsafe). The prediction highlights worn lab coats and goggles and implies adequacy/safety, never mentioning the missing gloves. It fails to justify the unsafe PPE category and contradicts the GT driver."
image0232,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags an unsafe PPE issue: missing eye protection. The prediction instead emphasizes correct PPE (hairnets, gloves) and frames it as a bio lab, implying adequacy/safety. It omits the key missing goggles detail and misleads on category and safety status."
image0236,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsafe due to missing eye protection (PPE). Prediction ignores this, instead highlights gloves and implies adherence/safety, and even assumes a biological lab. Contradicts the GT driver and misleads on safety status and lab type."
image0250,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsafe due to missing eye protection; prediction instead claims adequate PPE (lab coats, gloves, hairnets) and implies bio lab safety, never mentioning the missing eye protection. Contradicts GT and fails to justify unsafe status or the key driver."
image0253,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsecured hair as the safety issue; prediction focuses on gloves/goggles and implies safety in a chemical lab. It misses the key hazard and contradicts the unsafe rationale, with wrong drivers/categories."
image0260,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction highlights PPE (lab coat, gloves), supporting safety, but assumes a chemical lab without GT support and provides minimal specific evidence beyond PPE."
image0265,2,Partial,"GT provides no rationale (common for SAFE), so there’s nothing specific to match. The prediction asserts bio-lab context and presence of mask/gloves to justify safety, but these details can’t be verified against GT and may be speculative. No direct contradiction, but linkage to GT labels is weak."
image0266,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction notes PPE (gloves, lab coat), supporting safety, but it speculates on a biological lab type without GT support and doesn’t clearly tie to labels/categories. No clear contradictions, but somewhat generic and mildly speculative."
image0267,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely SAFE), so absence is fine. The prediction claims safety due to goggles, but infers ‘chemical lab’ from a microscope (likely incorrect) and equates presence of goggles with proper PPE without evidence they’re used. Limited linkage to PPE/SOP/WO categories and overconfident lab-type claim."
image0269,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction mentions PPE (lab coat, gloves), which loosely supports safety, but it does not state the safety status and assumes a biological lab type without evidence. Reasoning is incomplete with respect to labels (status/lab type/categories)."

image0284,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction reasonably indicates a safe scenario with PPE (lab coats, gloves) and gives a lab type (biological). However, the bio-lab inference and glove presence are unverified by GT and could be speculative; lacks further specifics or SOP/WO discussion."

image0307,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction aligns with safety by citing specific PPE (mask, gloves). However, it assumes a bio lab without GT support and doesn’t address other labels or drivers, so alignment is limited."
image0311,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction reasonably implies SAFE and a bio lab, citing specific PPE (lab coat, gloves) and presence of a microscope. No invented hazards. Minor gap: lab type and categories aren’t confirmed by GT and categories (PPE/SOP/WO) aren’t explicitly addressed beyond PPE presence."
image0315,2,Partial,"GT provides no details (typical for SAFE), so alignment relies on implied labels. The prediction notes PPE (lab coats, gloves), which supports safety, but it assumes a bio lab without evidence and doesn’t explicitly state safety status or cover categories beyond PPE. Limited linkage to GT labels and potential lab-type hallucination."
image0316,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typically SAFE). The prediction cites specific PPE (gloves, mask, goggles), supporting a safe/PPE-aligned rationale. However, it assumes a bio lab and doesn’t clearly state safety status; lab type can’t be verified from GT. No direct contradictions, but specificity to GT is limited."
image0326,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction notes PPE and infers a biological lab from microscope/test tubes but does not explicitly state safety status or tie to categories (PPE/SOP/WO).

image0361,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction implies safety via PPE (gloves) and good housekeeping, which plausibly supports a safe label. However, it speculates a bio lab type and glove presence without GT confirmation, making the rationale somewhat generic and partially speculative."
image0363,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical of SAFE). The prediction notes PPE present (gloves, goggles), supporting a safe assessment and aligning with PPE category. No invented hazards. Minor gap: safety status not stated explicitly and lab type is speculative without tying to categories/SOP/WO."
image0366,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction describes PPE present (goggles, gloves) and a chemical lab context, which supports a safe status. However, without GT specifics it’s fairly generic and doesn’t address SOP/WO categories, so alignment can’t be fully verified."

image1284,2,Partial,"GT rationale is empty (typical for SAFE), so safety status likely safe; the prediction aligns by implying safe conduct. However, it adds unverifiable specifics (chem lab, presence of gloves, SOP adherence) not supported by GT and provides no concrete GT-linked drivers, weakening alignment."
image1290,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Correctly identifies an electrical lab, but contradicts GT by claiming gloves and no hazards; GT cites lack of PPE, improper hand near live circuits (SOP), and poor workspace organization (WO). Misses all key unsafe drivers."
image1295,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The prediction aligns on safety status (safe) and lab type (chemical) by noting beakers/test tubes. However, it is generic and lacks concrete safety evidence (e.g., PPE, organized bench) and includes a speculative point about the blurred background. No contradictions, but limited specificity."
image1296,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely SAFE), so specifics can’t be verified. The prediction implies good SOP/WO but never clearly states safety status and makes speculative claims (biological lab based on generic items, documents implying SOPs). Weak linkage to explicit labels and potential overreach."
image1315,1,Weak,"GT has no details (common for SAFE), so specifics can’t be verified. The prediction asserts a chemical lab and safety from an ‘orderly workspace’ without concrete PPE/SOP/WO evidence and likely hallucinates lab type. Too generic with no key drivers cited."
image1320,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details, which implies SAFE; the prediction invents hazards (lack of ventilation, mouse) and suggests unsafe conditions. This contradicts the implied safety status and introduces unsupported specifics. Any lab-type correctness cannot offset the mismatch on safety and categories."
image1332,2,Partial,"GT details are absent (likely SAFE), and the model claims a safe chemistry lab, which aligns generally. However, the justification is vague and includes a minor inaccuracy (“absence of hazardous materials” despite chemical bottles). It doesn’t cite concrete safety drivers or PPE/SOP/WO evidence."
image1340,3,Adequate,"GT details are absent (likely SAFE). The prediction treats the scene as safe and identifies a chemistry lab (fume hoods) with cleanliness/organization, which aligns generally. However, it speculates about PPE being ‘implied’ and doesn’t clearly tie to PPE/SOP/WO categories or cite concrete drivers, reducing specificity."
image1343,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns on safety and cites general safe features (organized workspace, signage). However, it asserts specific lab type/equipment (chemistry, fume hoods, safety cabinets) that aren’t confirmed by GT and doesn’t clearly tie to PPE/SOP/WO categories, so it lacks verifiable specificity."
image1344,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction implies a safe chemical lab and references PPE/WO/SOP, which aligns with the implied labels. However, it asserts specifics (gloves, graduated cylinders, orderly beakers) not supported by GT text, so alignment is generic rather than evidenced by GT drivers."
image1349,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction infers a chemistry lab and safe status, citing fume hood and organized, labeled workspace (SOP/WO). Specific and consistent, though it doesn’t address PPE and cannot match absent GT details."
image1353,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction asserts electrical hazards and missing PPE, implying UNSAFE, which contradicts the implied safe label and introduces unsupported hazards with no GT drivers."
image1357,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The prediction asserts the scene is safe and cites specific items (computers, power strips), aligning with a safe assessment. However, it weakly justifies safety by implying ‘safety protocols’ from power strips and assumes an electronics lab without GT support, making the reasoning somewhat generic/speculative."
image1358,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely SAFE), and the prediction implies safety via labeled test tubes (SOP/WO), but it’s vague and speculative about lab type (assumes biological) and does not clearly map to categories. Limited specific evidence beyond labeling."
image1361,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction infers a safe chemistry lab and cites PPE (goggles) and organized workspace (WO), aligning with implied labels. However, it’s generic and assumes specifics not confirmed by GT, with no GT-cited drivers to match."
image1362,3,Adequate,"Correctly infers SAFE status (GT has no details, typical for safe). Provides some justification, but it’s generic (organized, signage) and assumes a biological lab without GT confirmation. No specific PPE/SOP/WO drivers cited."
image1365,2,Partial,"GT has no details (typical of SAFE). The prediction implies safety and a chemical lab with organized, labeled bottles, which is plausible, but it asserts specific PPE (gloves, goggles) without GT support—likely a hallucination. Limited linkage to explicit GT drivers/categories."
image1370,2,Partial,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction asserts safety, which aligns, but it introduces unverified specifics (chemical safety cabinets, chem lab) and lacks linkage to PPE/SOP/WO. Reasoning is generic and includes possible hallucination."
image1371,3,Adequate,"Aligns with implied SAFE status and offers specific observations (organized shelves, labeled containers). However, it speculates on lab type (biological) and SOP category not supported by the GT (which has no details). Lacks verifiable GT drivers, so cannot score higher."
image1380,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction plausibly identifies an EE lab (oscilloscope, multimeter) and justifies safety via organized cables/workspace. However, it’s fairly generic, doesn’t explicitly map to PPE/SOP/WO beyond work organization, and there are no specific GT drivers to match, so full alignment cannot be confirmed."
image1384,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction labels it safe and as an electronics lab with generic support (clean/organized, no chemicals). It lacks concrete, image-based drivers and does not address PPE/SOP/WO specifics, but it aligns on safety and gives at least one supporting detail."
image1387,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (expected for SAFE). The prediction implies safety and cites concrete PPE/SOP elements (goggles, gloves, fume hood), which supports a safe status. However, the lab type (chemistry) and specific drivers cannot be confirmed from GT, so alignment is only partial."
image1389,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags an unsafe condition: no guards around a robot. The prediction claims the scene is safe, cites SOP compliance, and does not mention the missing robot guards. It also shifts to an electrical engineering framing, missing the key robotics guarding hazard."
image1394,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT unsafe status and misses key drivers (open containers, unattended workspace). Asserts SOP adherence and safety glasses without evidence, failing to cite GT-specific issues."
image1400,1,Weak,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE), but the prediction speculates a chemical lab from monitors and implies PPE without evidence. It neither clearly states safety status nor addresses PPE/SOP/WO categories with concrete observations, and likely misidentifies lab type."
image1406,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags an unsafe, cluttered workspace; the prediction claims the workspace is organized with no clutter and implies safety. This directly contradicts the key GT driver and safety status."
image1413,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT by calling the workspace organized and safe, ignoring GT hazards (loose floor cables, cluttered tools/equipment). Misses WO issues entirely. Only lab type (engineering/robotics) aligns, but the core safety reasoning is wrong."
image1414,3,Adequate,"GT has no details, implying SAFE; the prediction infers a safe EE setting from an organized electronics/computer workspace. This aligns with safety status but is generic and speculative on lab type, with no concrete PPE/SOP/WO drivers cited."
image1418,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction implies safety and gives a basic justification (organized workspace). However, it’s generic, doesn’t reference PPE/SOP/WO, and the asserted lab type (chemistry) is not substantiated beyond generic items; specificity is limited."
image1422,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: implies safe adherence instead of unsafe due to missing gloves. Fails to note PPE issue (gloves). Only loosely matches lab type (chemistry), but overall misleading."
image1427,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: claims safe SOP adherence, while GT flags unsafe due to unmonitored, uncapped tubes. Misses key hazard and provides no matching specifics."
image1431,4,Strong,"Correctly infers SAFE (consistent with no GT details) and identifies an electronics lab using concrete cues (oscilloscopes, multimeters). Safety justification is generic (“safety protocols”) and lacks specific drivers (e.g., controlled wiring, PPE/SOP/WO), so not exceptional but no contradictions."
image1435,2,Partial,"Likely matches SAFE status, but it misidentifies the lab type as chemical despite citing oscilloscope/multimeter (indicative of an electronics lab). The PPE note is generic, and the claim of no hazards is unsubstantiated. Significant lab-type error reduces alignment with implied labels."
image1450,1,Weak,"Misses the key GT drivers (missing gloves and eye protection) and does not state the unsafe status. Focuses on lab coat and lab type instead, offering little alignment with the PPE issues cited in GT."
image1466,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). Prediction correctly judges it safe and cites lab coats (PPE). However, it’s generic (“no visible hazards”), asserts a chemical lab without GT support, and lacks specific category justification beyond PPE."
image1467,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction correctly labels the scene as safe and gives at least one concrete detail (microscopes, goggles, organized benches). However, it provides generic justifications, doesn’t tie to specific GT drivers or categories (PPE/SOP/WO), and the lab type claim can’t be verified against GT."
image1470,3,Adequate,"GT has no details (likely SAFE), which the prediction implicitly supports by citing organization and SOP adherence. It correctly infers a chemical lab and mentions SOPs, but evidence is generic and speculative (glassware ⇒ SOP), with no concrete safety drivers or PPE/WO specifics."
image1472,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns with a SAFE assessment and plausibly identifies a chemical lab, citing PPE (lab coats, gloves) and an organized workspace. No contradictions to GT. Not Exceptional only because lab type/categories can’t be fully verified against absent GT specifics."
image1473,4,Strong,"Aligns with a SAFE image by citing present PPE (lab coat, goggles). Specific and supports safety. However, it assumes a bio lab type not confirmed by GT, which is an unsupported detail."
image1474,2,Partial,GT has no details (likely safe). The prediction notes PPE (gloves) but does not clearly state safety status and assumes a chemical lab without GT support. Limited linkage to labels and includes a speculative lab type.
image1477,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags an unsafe chem lab due to unlabeled, uncapped flasks (SOP issues). The prediction claims the scene is safe based on general features and ignores the key hazards, getting the safety status and drivers wrong (though chem type is implied)."
image1481,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsafe due to missing gloves and eye protection (PPE). The prediction only notes lab coats (implying safety) and ignores the key missing PPE, contradicting the GT drivers with no supporting details."
image1485,2,Partial,"GT has no details (likely SAFE). The prediction notes PPE (gloves, goggles), which can support safety, but it assumes a bio lab without evidence and doesn’t clearly state safety status or address categories. Incomplete linkage to implied labels."
