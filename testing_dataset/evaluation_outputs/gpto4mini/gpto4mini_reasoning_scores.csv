image0007,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction argues SAFE with concrete PPE/SOP/housekeeping points, aligning with the implied label and categories. It also asserts a biosafety cabinet (lab type) which isn’t verifiable from GT, so can’t award exceptional."
image0008,4,Strong,"Aligns with implied SAFE status and covers PPE, SOP, and workspace organization with concrete points. No contradictions. Slightly generic on lab type (implied wet lab but not stated), and no GT details to explicitly echo, so not fully exceptional."
image0009,5,Exceptional,"GT has no details, which implies SAFE. The prediction supports a safe wet-lab scene with concrete evidence: PPE (gloves, coat, goggles), proper pipette use (SOP), and organized test tubes in a rack (WO). No contradictions or hallucinated hazards."
image0019,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction presents a safe scenario with specific PPE, SOP, and good housekeeping details, which plausibly align. However, with no GT drivers to confirm against and no explicit lab-type justification, alignment cannot be fully verified."
image0024,4,Strong,"GT has no details, implying a SAFE image. The prediction aligns by describing proper PPE and a clean workspace with no SOP/housekeeping issues. It’s specific and justifies safety, though it doesn’t identify lab type and some specifics (e.g., respirator) can’t be verified against GT."
image0029,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns by characterizing a safe scenario and citing PPE, SOP, and workspace organization. No contradictions, but it adds unverifiable specifics (e.g., respirators, clamped glassware) and doesn’t clearly state lab type, so not fully exceptional."
image0033,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns with a SAFE chemistry lab: notes appropriate PPE and tidy/controlled workspace (PPE/SOP/WO). Specific PPE items are plausible but cannot be fully verified against GT, hence not Exceptional."
image0034,4,Strong,"GT has no details, which implies SAFE. The prediction aligns: notes proper PPE and a tidy workspace/no SOP issues, supporting a safe assessment and relevant categories. Slight over-specificity (claims of a face mask and chemical handling) not verifiable from GT prevents full marks."
image0047,4,Strong,"GT has no details (consistent with a SAFE image). The prediction argues safety with concrete PPE/SOP evidence (goggles, gloves, suit, proper handling), aligning with the implied safe label and categories. No contradictions. Cannot fully verify lab type or all drivers due to absent GT details, so not Exceptional."
image0049,4,Strong,"GT rationale is absent (implies SAFE). The prediction aligns by describing a safe scenario with PPE, SOP adherence, and organized workspace (WO). No contradictions, but lab type isn’t explicitly stated and specifics (e.g., mask/gloves) can’t be verified against GT, preventing an exceptional score."
image0057,3,Adequate,"GT rationale is absent, implying a SAFE image. The prediction aligns by describing proper PPE and a tidy work area (no SOP issues). However, it adds unverified specifics (electronics/laser lab, oscilloscopes/optical fibers, orange goggles) that can’t be confirmed from GT, so it lacks precise alignment beyond safety status."
image0058,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The model provides specific safe cues (safety glasses, tidy/organized bench) and covers PPE/WO with no contradictions. Minor gap: does not address lab type or SOP, so not fully comprehensive."
image0066,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns with a safe scene and cites concrete PPE, SOP (emergency stop), and workspace organization. No contradictions. Slight gap: it doesn’t explicitly state the lab type, and there are no GT drivers to match verbatim."
image0069,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns with an implied SAFE status and cites PPE and good housekeeping (PPE/WO) with concrete observations. Lab type isn’t specified/confirmable from GT, so can’t claim full alignment on that dimension."
image0082,4,Strong,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The model reasonably identifies a safe scene, citing PPE (lab coats, gloves) and good work organization (clean bench). No contradictions. The claimed biological lab type is plausible but unverified by GT details, keeping it just short of exceptional."
image0089,2,Partial,"GT has no details (implies SAFE). The prediction introduces a PPE deficiency (missing goggles), which conflicts with a safe label and speculates on lab type. It does note housekeeping (organized bench), but lacks explicit labels and weakly aligns with implied GT."
image0091,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT rationale is absent (implying SAFE). The prediction asserts UNSAFE in a bio lab with specific PPE/SOP violations (missing gloves, direct contact), contradicting the implied safe label and introducing unverified hazards."
image0099,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (implies SAFE per dataset note). The prediction claims a PPE violation (missing gloves) and handling chemicals, asserting UNSAFE. This contradicts the implied safe status and introduces unsupported specifics."
image0101,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (implying SAFE). The prediction asserts missing PPE (goggles/face shields) and suggests unsafe conditions under a microscope, contradicting the implied safe label and introducing unsupported specifics."
image0103,4,Strong,"GT rationale is absent (typical for SAFE). The prediction implies a SAFE electronics lab and cites PPE and organized workspace, aligning with likely labels. It provides concrete safety cues (PPE, clean bench), but some specifics (lab coats, magnifying eyewear) may be over-specific given no GT details to confirm, preventing an exceptional score."
image0105,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details, implying SAFE; model invents a SOP hazard (missing fume extraction) and extra PPE specifics. This contradicts the expected safe/no-issue case and does not align with GT labels."
image0110,4,Strong,"GT has no details, which typically indicates SAFE. The model’s reasoning asserts safe practice with specific PPE (suit, gloves) and controlled environment (no spills/clutter), aligning with a safe label. However, it doesn’t address lab type or categories explicitly, so not fully comprehensive."
image0112,4,Strong,"Likely aligns with a SAFE image (no GT details expected). Cites concrete PPE (lab coats, safety glasses, gloves) and absence of spills/clutter/SOP violations, justifying safety. Slight gap: does not clearly state lab type or explicitly map to categories, though it implicitly covers PPE and WO/SOP."
image0116,4,Strong,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The model’s reasoning aligns with a safe scenario and cites PPE, SOP, and workspace organization with concrete examples. No contradictions. Minor gap: lab type is only implied (chem/wet lab) and safety status isn’t explicitly stated, preventing an exceptional score."
image0117,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction cites proper PPE (lab coats, goggles, gloves) and good workspace organization, aligning with a SAFE judgment and covering PPE/WO. It doesn’t explicitly state safety status or lab type, so not fully comprehensive, but no contradictions."
image0121,4,Strong,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The prediction asserts safe conditions with specific PPE (gloves, goggles, hair nets) and orderly workspace (no spills), aligning with a safe label. It doesn’t specify lab type or additional categories, so not fully exceptional."
image0125,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details, implying SAFE. The prediction asserts a PPE deficiency (missing gloves) and suggests a safety issue, contradicting the implied safe status and offering no correct lab-type/category alignment."
image0131,5,Exceptional,"Directly matches GT: identifies missing eye protection (goggles) as the PPE issue making it unsafe. Correct category (PPE), no contradictions or extra hazards invented."
image0143,3,Adequate,"Correctly identifies missing eye protection (key GT driver) and unsafe PPE. However, it adds unsupported claims about missing gloves and pipetting practices not in GT, making the reasoning partly speculative."
image0145,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags missing gloves (PPE) making it unsafe. Prediction claims proper PPE (goggles, lab coat) and focuses on workspace organization, contradicting the key issue and missing the glove absence entirely."
image0154,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsafe due to missing gloves (PPE). Prediction claims proper PPE and emphasizes WO/SOP, contradicting GT and omitting the key issue."
image0156,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT unsafe status and ignores key driver (missing gloves). Focuses on goggles and tidy workspace (WO) not cited in GT, providing no alignment with the rationale."
image0158,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: asserts proper PPE and safety in a chemistry lab and does not mention missing eye protection. Hallucinates adequate protection instead of identifying absent goggles, the key unsafe driver."
image0163,4,Strong,"Correctly identifies missing gloves and missing eye protection (PPE) and implies a chemical lab, justifying unsafe status. However, it omits the GT detail about chemicals near a computer (WO/SOP). The added note about holding a flask at eye level is extra and not in GT but doesn’t contradict it."
image0168,2,Partial,"Matches lab type and notes missing gloves, but contradicts GT by claiming goggles are worn (GT: missing goggles) and adds loose hair not in GT. Key driver (missing goggles) is missed, weakening alignment."
image0169,2,Partial,"Correctly identifies the key GT issue: no gloves (PPE), implying unsafe. However, it adds ungrounded claims about missing eye protection and a specific biosafety/microscope context not in GT, introducing minor inaccuracies."
image0171,4,Strong,"Correctly identifies missing eye protection (PPE), aligning with unsafe status and PPE category. Adds an extra claim about missing gloves not in GT, which is unnecessary and slightly speculative, preventing an exceptional score."
image0174,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Directly contradicts GT: claims gloves and hair nets are worn and scenario is safe, while GT flags missing gloves and unsecured long hair (unsafe). Misidentifies PPE details and safety status."
image0201,5,Exceptional,"Directly matches GT: identifies missing eye protection (PPE) as the safety issue, implying unsafe. Adds non-contradictory context (lab coat/gloves present) without inventing hazards."
image0208,4,Strong,"Matches unsafe status and PPE issue by noting missing gloves; aligns with lab context. Misses the GT driver of unsecured hair and introduces an extra PPE issue (no lab coats) not cited in GT, but no direct contradictions."
image0211,4,Strong,"Accurately identifies inadequate eye protection and poor workspace organization (clutter/tangled cables), matching PPE and WO. Implies electrical lab hazards. However, it misses the GT’s specific SOP issue: unsafe handling of exposed circuits and lack of insulating gloves/tools."
image0214,5,Exceptional,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction identifies a safe scenario, correctly infers an electrical/battery testing context, and justifies safety with specific PPE (glasses, gloves, lab coat) and absence of procedural/housekeeping issues. No contradictions with GT."
image0216,4,Strong,"GT has no details, implying SAFE. The model describes proper PPE and good housekeeping/SOP/WO, aligning with a safe scene and not contradicting GT. However, it doesn’t specify lab type and only implies safety status rather than stating it explicitly."
image0224,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT: claims proper PPE and safe environment, while GT flags untied hair and lack of proper PPE making it unsafe. Ignores the key PPE violations and instead emphasizes cleanliness and organization."
image0229,3,Adequate,"Correctly identifies unsafe due to missing gloves (PPE) in a chemical context. However, it adds an unsupported SOP issue (lack of fume hood/containment) and extra specifics not in GT, which is a minor hallucination preventing a higher score."
image0232,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsafe due to missing eye protection; the prediction instead asserts proper PPE/SOP and does not mention absent eye protection, implying safety. This contradicts the key GT driver and safety status."
image0236,5,Exceptional,Directly matches GT by identifying missing eye protection (PPE) as the safety issue; implies unsafe appropriately. Mentions absence of goggles/safety glasses with no contradictions. Extra note about gloves/lab coats doesn’t conflict.
image0250,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"Contradicts GT. GT flags missing eye protection (unsafe PPE). Prediction claims proper PPE and SOP adherence, never mentions absent eye protection, implying safety."
image0253,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT flags unsecured hair as the safety issue (unsafe). The prediction claims no violations and emphasizes goggles/gloves and a clean workspace, contradicting the GT and omitting the key unsecured-hair hazard."
image0260,4,Strong,"GT has no details (consistent with SAFE). The prediction aligns by describing a safe scene and cites PPE (goggles, gloves) and SOP (proper pipetting, no spills/clutter). Some specifics (chemical-resistant gloves, conical flask) are somewhat speculative given no GT details, preventing an exceptional score."
image0265,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction implies a safe chemistry setting and cites PPE and absence of SOP/WO issues, aligning with the implied safe label. No contradictions, though some specifics (e.g., face mask) can’t be verified from GT, so not fully confirmable for Exceptional."

image1361,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT provides no details (typical for SAFE), while the prediction asserts SOP/WO hazards (unlabeled bottles, tangled cables). This introduces issues not supported by GT and likely contradicts the implied safe status; no overlap with GT drivers."
image1362,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical of SAFE). The model cites a clear safe indicator (clean, uncluttered bench → good workspace organization/WO) and avoids hallucinations. It’s concise but doesn’t mention lab type or other categories, hence not exceptional."
image1365,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (implies SAFE). The prediction invents hazards (mixed chem/bio, unlabeled containers, contamination risk) and argues unsafety, contradicting the implied safe label and hallucinating specifics without GT support."
image1370,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns by implying safety and citing a specific WO cue (neat bench, no spills/clutter). No contradictions or hallucinations. Coverage is minimal (only WO; no lab type or additional cues), so not Exceptional."
image1371,4,Strong,"GT has no details (implies SAFE). The prediction describes a clean, organized chemistry workspace with closed containers and no spills—specific safe features consistent with SOP/WO and no contradictions. Solid justification of SAFE and chem lab type, though full alignment with any unseen GT specifics cannot be confirmed."
image1380,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details, implying SAFE; the prediction claims a PPE violation and unsafe status, contradicting GT and inventing an issue (mentions users’ PPE). While electronics lab ID is plausible, the core safety label is wrong."
image1384,5,Exceptional,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The model correctly infers an electronics lab, asserts SAFE status, and cites concrete evidence (multimeters/oscilloscopes, organized benches, overhead cable routing, unobstructed floors). It references SOP/PPE with no violations and introduces no contradictions or hallucinations."
image1387,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (indicative of SAFE). The prediction asserts the scene is unsafe with PPE and work-organization issues (missing goggles/gloves/coats, open containers/clutter), contradicting the implied safe label and introducing unverified specifics. Lab type claim (chemistry) is unconfirmed."
image1389,3,Adequate,"Correctly identifies a robotics context and the key GT issue: a moving manipulator without guarding (SOP). However, it adds speculative hazards (exposed cables, missing PPE, clutter) and extra categories (PPE, WO) not supported by the GT."
image1394,2,Partial,"Partially overlaps with GT by noting containers stored openly, but it never identifies the unattended workspace. It adds unrelated/hallucinatory issues (missing PPE, unlabeled chemicals) not in GT. Linkage to the key GT drivers (open containers + unattended) is weak."
image1400,4,Strong,"Correctly implies SAFE status and identifies EE lab with concrete evidence (oscilloscopes, power supplies, organized bench). Mentions a PPE concern (ESD strap/glasses) that’s not reflected in GT details for safe images, which is an unnecessary extra note but doesn’t contradict the safe assessment."
image1406,5,Exceptional,"Directly aligns with GT 'cluttered workspace' by citing poor housekeeping (WO) with specific examples (reagent bottles, pipettes, phone on bench). Supports unsafe status with concrete evidence and no contradictions."
image1413,5,Exceptional,"Matches GT hazards: calls out loose cables on the floor and clutter on the bench (poor workspace organization). Implies unsafe status, identifies engineering/electrical lab appropriately, and frames issues as workspace organization/tripping hazards. No contradictions or hallucinations."
image1414,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (typical for a SAFE image). The model asserts multiple electrical hazards and missing PPE/LOTO, contradicting the implied safe label and adding unsupported specifics."
image1418,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT rationale is absent, implying a SAFE image. The model asserts missing PPE and poor organization (unsafe) and cites hazards not supported by GT, contradicting the implied safety label."
image1422,4,Strong,"Correctly identifies the key GT driver: missing gloves (PPE), implying unsafe. Adds an extra claim about missing goggles not in GT, but core reasoning aligns and justifies the unsafe/PPE label."
image1427,3,Adequate,"Correctly identifies open/uncapped tubes (SOP), aligning with the GT’s key hazard. However, it misses the ‘unmonitored’ aspect and adds unsupported PPE and housekeeping issues not in the GT, diluting alignment with the intended categories."
image1431,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction invents hazards (tangled cables, fall/trip), implying unsafe and contradicting the implied safe status; no PPE/SOP/WO alignment with GT."
image1435,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (indicative of a SAFE image). The prediction asserts unsafe conditions (missing lab coat, insulating gloves, safety glasses with exposed electricals), contradicting the implied safe status and introducing ungrounded specifics."
image1450,4,Strong,"Accurately identifies the key GT drivers—missing gloves and eye protection (PPE) in a chem context—justifying unsafe status. However, it adds an SOP infraction (resting chin above reagents) not in the GT, slightly overextending the categories beyond PPE."
image1466,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT rationale is absent (implying SAFE per dataset note). The prediction claims a chemical lab is unsafe due to missing goggles/gloves (PPE/SOP), contradicting the implied safe status and introducing unverified hazards."
image1467,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT details are absent, which implies SAFE. The prediction asserts unsafe conditions (missing PPE, absent signage) and labels it as biological work without evidence, contradicting the implied safe label and introducing unsupported hazards."
image1470,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no rationale (implying SAFE per dataset note). The prediction asserts WO hazards (clutter, lack of containment) and implies UNSAFE, contradicting the implied safety status with invented specifics. No alignment on labels or drivers."
image1472,0,Incorrect/Misleading,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction asserts PPE violations and implies unsafety with specific hazards, contradicting the implied safe label and introducing unsupported details."
image1473,5,Exceptional,"GT has no details (implies SAFE). The prediction identifies a bio lab context (biosafety cabinet) and notes proper PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses) and SOP (working inside BSC), justifying a safe status with concrete evidence and no contradictions."
image1474,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction highlights proper PPE (gloves) and good workspace organization, supporting a safe assessment with no contradictions. It doesn’t specify lab type or explicitly state safety status, so not fully exceptional."
image1477,4,Strong,"Correctly identifies the key GT drivers: unlabeled and open (uncapped) flasks, supporting unsafe SOP issues in a chem lab. However, it adds speculative points about lack of fume hood/spill containment and PPE that are not in the GT and may be extraneous, preventing an exceptional score."
image1481,4,Strong,"Correctly identifies missing gloves and eye protection (PPE), matching GT and justifying unsafe status. Adds an extra hazard (loose ties) not in GT, which slightly exceeds the provided rationale."
image1485,4,Strong,"GT has no details (typical for SAFE). The prediction aligns by asserting safe status with specific PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coat) and organized workspace (no spills), covering PPE/SOP/WO. Minor gap: lab type not explicitly identified and specifics can’t be verified against GT details."
